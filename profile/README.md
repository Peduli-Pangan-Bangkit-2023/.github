### BACKGROUNDER:

Food waste is food that can still be consumed by humans but is thrown away and eventually accumulates in landfills. Food waste that accumulates in landfills produces methane gas and carbon dioxide. Both of these are unhealthy for the earth. The impact of food waste is not only on the environment. There is the impact on the food crisis, the most feared impact due to the high source of food that is not produced and utilized properly. While there are many proposed solutions, combating food waste remains a significant challenge. According to a report from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) titled Food Waste Index 2021, Indonesia is still the country with the highest food waste production in Southeast Asia. To address these issues, we would like to contribute to developing an end-of-day food waste sales app in partnership with food businesses.
Peduli Pangan is the solution to these challenges. The app helps establishments sell wasted food. App users can search for restaurants, cafes, bakeries and other food stores to order surprise bags of leftovers at the end of the day. The Peduli Pangan app also allows users to get valuable advice on whether leftover food is still fit for consumption. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, Peduli Pangan accurately predicts what is fit for consumption so that consumers have no hesitation in enjoying food that is still healthy. By providing solutions through this app, we are on a mission to raise public awareness of the problem of food waste, ultimately designed to reduce food waste by connecting food sellers with buyers who are willing to purchase surplus food at a reduced price. This helps sellers reduce losses due to unsold food, and buyers can get quality food at a more affordable price.

To achieve and realize that goals, Our team have worked on:

### Machine Learning
- Builds a model for consumable food detection feature with TensorFlow using CNN Algorithm and converts it into a TensorFlow Lite file.

### Cloud Computing
- Creates an API using the App Engine service.
- Creates API endpoints to receive requests.
- Stores data using Cloud SQL.
- Stores images using Cloud Storage.
- Creates authentication features using Firebase.
- Implements order notifications using Cloud Firestore.

### Mobile Development
- Builds two Android applications: seller and consumer.
- Designs UI/UX.
- Deploys TensorFlow Lite to the application.
